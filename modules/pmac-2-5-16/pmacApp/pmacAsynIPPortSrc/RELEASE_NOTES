1. Changes to pmacAsynMotor

* Removed include of motorSupport.dbd, so applications will need to include 
this manually from now.

* Added pmacSetOpenLoopEncoderAxis axis configuration routine, to read back the 
position from a different axis number.

1. Changes to pmacAsynIPPort

Ported to work with Asyn 4-10. It still compiles with Asyn 4-9, but
is no longer compatible.

Made extensive changes to the pmacAsynIPPort.c file to enable better
support for ethernet based Delta Tau PMACS. This is an asyn interpose
layer that deals with ethernet specific PMAC headers and trailers.

Also added new configuration functions for use in the IOC shell.

2. How to configure an IOC to use an ethernet PMAC:

pmacAsynIPConfigure("pmacLV", "172.23.243.156:1025")
pmacAsynMotorCreate("pmacLV", 0, 0, 8)
drvAsynMotorConfigure("PMAC1", "pmacAsynMotor", 0, 9)

similary for a 2nd ethernet PMAC in the same IOC:

pmacAsynIPConfigure("pmacLV2", "172.23.243.157:1025")
pmacAsynMotorCreate("pmacLV2", 0, 1, 8)
drvAsynMotorConfigure("PMAC2", "pmacAsynMotor", 1, 9)

3. To change to PMAC driver polling rates in the IOC shell:

To change the polling period when the motor is not moving:
pmacSetIdlePollPeriod(0, 500)

To change the polling period when the motor is moving.
pmacSetMovingPollPeriod(0, 50)

The first parameter is the 'card'. The second parameter is the
polling period in milliseconds.

NOTE: The default idle polling period is 500ms. The default moving
polling period is 100ms.

1. Backwards incompatible changes since the last release.

This release chould be completely backwards compatible with the old
release with the exception of the VxWorks startup scripts. These need an
extra line to create asyn ports that are used for ASCII communication
and a change to pmacDrvConfig to say which asyn port the ASCII
communications should use.

For example, previously you may have configured the pmac with the lines:

pmacVmeConfig (0, 0x7FA000, 0x700000, 0xa1, 6)
pmacDrvConfig (0, 0, 0, 0, 0)

Now, to get the same effect, you must use the lines:

pmacVmeConfig (0, 0x7FA000, 0x700000, 0xa1, 6)
pmacAsynConfig( "PMAC_MBX_PORT_", 0 )
pmacDrvConfig (0, 0, 0, 0, "PMAC_MBX_PORT_0" )

The parameters for pmacAsynConfig are two character strings which are
the prefix of asyn ports to be set up for each configured PMAC card's
mailbox and DPRAM ascii buffer respectively. If the string is not NULL,
the routine will create an Asyn port and append the card number to the
string prefix. In the above example, since we configured only one card,
and gave it number 0, pmacAsynConfig will create a single asyn port
PMAC_MBX_PORT_0. It will not create any asyn ports for the DPRAM ASCII
buffer since the second parameter is NULL.

The final parameter for pmacDrvConfig has also changed. Formerly, it was
a disableMbx flag. Now, it is the asyn port to be used for ASCII
communication. It can be an Mailbox, DPRAM ASCII, serial port or IP port
(However, asyn support for the PMAC IP interface isn't implemented yet).


2. New features.

Since the ASCII communications at the lowest level use an asynOctet
port, then you can use other asynOctet upper level software. Examples of
this are:

a. asynRecord

You can connect any asyn record on your IOC to any available asynOctet
port connected to your PMAC and use this as a simple command line interface.

b. Motor Record

The directory pmacAsynMotorSrc contains a PMAC motor record driver in
the new asynMotor framework. To configure motor support for all motors
on a card, add the following lines to the configuration lines given
above:

pmacAsynMotorCreate("PMAC_MAX_PORT_0", 0, 0, 32 );
drvAsynMotorConfigure("pmac0", "pmacAsynMotor", 0, 33)

The first of these configures the pmacAsynMotor driver and the second
configures the generic drvAsynMotor layer. Note that this requires >
release 5.9 of motor support and >= release 4.6 of asyn support.

The parameters for the first routine are:
 - port (char *) Asyn port for PMAC ASCII communicatons.
 - address (int) Asyn port address. Always 0.
 - card (int)    Card number to use. Is not necessarily the same card #
                 used in the other initialisation routines, but probably
                 should be.
 - naxes (int)   Number of axes to configure. 1 based.

The parameters for the second routine are:
 - port (char *)   drvAsynMotor asyn port to be created.
 - drvSup (char *) Driver support entry table name for driver. For PMAC
                   this is pmacAsynMotor.
 - card (int)      Card number specified in pmacAsynMotorCreate for this
                   axis.
 - nAxes (int)     #axes to configure (zero based). Note that since PMAC
                   axes are 1 based and drvAsynMotor axes are 0 based
                   this will generate a non-fatal warning of the form:
                   <datestamp> drvAsynMotorConfigure: Failed to open axis 0

To connect motor records to this driver, use:

DTYP asynMotor and an
OUT  @asyn($(PORT),$(AXIS))

Where PORT is the asyn port and AXIS the motor axis #.

c. Streams.

You should be able to use streamDevice 2.0 and above to communicate
other ascii commands to the underlying asynOctet port. 

d. asynUploadFile

This is a generic routine to upload a file to an asyn port. For example:

asynUploadFile( "data/pmacTest.pmc", "PMAC_MBX_PORT_0", "\r", "\06" )

The parameters are:

 - filename (char *) File to upload.
 - asynPort (char *) asynOctet port to upload the file to.
 - out_term (char *) Output terminator to use at the end of every line
 - inp_term (char *) Input terminator to search for in response to every line.

All responses are ignored, the terminators just being scanned for as a handshake. If the writeread routine returns an error the routine exits printing the line number and


3. Known problems/still to do

a. Resolve the terminators for error notification. Currently,
     - The DPRAM and MBX ASCII drivers return an error as <BELL>ERRnnn<CR><ACK>
     - The serial line returns an error as <BELL>ERRnnn<CR>
   We need to adopt a standard. I prefer the first since then all
   transactions are terminated with an <ACK>, but then the serial line
   driver needs an interpose interface to add the trailing <ACK>.
b. Add windows support. This should be a asyn port using the PMAC
   windows drivers.
c. Add Linux PCI support. There is a Linux open/close/read/write
   driver that should fit in fairly simply. It might need an interpose
   interface to handle terminators.
d. Convert the Asyn PMAC drivers to use the CPP asynMotorController/Axis interface.
e. Add Diamond standard templates for PMAC co-ordinate systems.

Note for those implementing the asynOctet drivers they must emulate the
syntax of the PMAC serial port. Basically the means that on write "\r"
is used as a record terminator, and on read ACK is used for a success
terminator and <BELL>ERRnnn<CR><ACK> for an error response.
